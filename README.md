# gestured-2048
The popular game 2048 made better by using hand gestures as opposed to swipes!

## How to play?
Swipe the blocks in either the up, down, left, or right direction in order to move the blocks. Combine blocks of the same number to double the number, eventually making it to the 2048 block, in which case, you win! You can obviously keep going to increase your total score.

## Installation
Open up the project on Android Studio and compile. Connect your Android device and start playing.
